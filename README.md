# Robotic-Manipulator-with-Object-Detection
This project involves building a 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm that uses a single camera and computer vision to detect and approach a target object. The arm is controlled via an Arduino Mega, and its movements are guided by OpenCV-based color tracking on a computer. A real-time feedback loop allows the arm to locate an object, move towards it using inverse-kinematics-inspired directional control, and autonomously grip it using an ultrasonic sensor.
