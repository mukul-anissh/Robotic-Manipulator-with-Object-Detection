# Robotic-Manipulator-with-Object-Detection
This project involves building a 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm that uses a single camera and computer vision to detect and approach a target object. The arm is controlled via an Arduino Mega, and its movements are guided by OpenCV-based color tracking on a computer.
